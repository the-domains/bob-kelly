Realtime Vista Community

Back in 2007, Bob ran an online community for Realtime Publishers in the early days of the Windows Vista release. This involved several blog posts per week as well as a recorded podcast and answering questions for about a year's time.

An archive of the site can be found [here online][0] and [the podcast recordings are available online here][1].
